Jerard Chris Rei Sarinas Ogoy
s3824196 jeogoy@gmail.com
Born in the Philippines and migrated here in Australia 2009. I work full time as Assistant in nursing for about 6 years now. I speak English and tagalog. People say I have a patience of a saint and I clearly demonstrated with people who are in need of help. I play video games as a past time and to relieve stress. 

# Interest in IT
I started getting into IT because people I work with tends to tell that I should get into it. I usually solve IT problems at work most of the times. I don’t solve technical computer glitches, rather I solve the hardware stuff of it (eg. Printing, connection issues). 
I have chosen this school (RMIT) to study because they have a clear pathway towards a goal of studying. Rather than in one go for university, it breaks down subjects in small steps at a time.
I expect to learn basic IT information during the course and develop skills that is relevant to future career.

# Ideal Job
So far I don’t see an ideal job that is worth applying for at this time. But if there is I am looking at becoming a Software Engineer hopefully.
Well this work appeals to me not just of the name itself but the title of an engineer is quite appealing. It makes me feel like and expert in all sorts of software or an important person. I know it will require quite a bit of skill to become one but this is a start. 
They are many skills highlighted in the job description. All sort of Microsoft programs, HTML, an experience in .Net web development, able to demonstrate analytical and problem-solving skills, Git, a full on passion for software quality and maintainability. They also have a desirability to have a functional programming experience, an experience with CI and CD tooling (VSTS). All in all becoming a software engineer is time tedious and it needs to have a good set of skills to have.
Right now I do not have any of those set of skills listed above. Except of some basic Microsoft skills and some basic computer skills.
After the introduction to IT I tend to get more into engineering to get relevant skills and studies in the future. I might get to change my mind on what work I should do or the pathway that I should take. Il get into more of GIT and GITHUB. I will try to go into computer science and engineering I guess.
